- [ ] Render water on a separate texture to conditionally enable some effect that are rendering
      behind it (like fog).

- [ ] Create a tool to parse structure file and generate Rust source code from it for the biome
      generator. Could be a proc_macro, but I know that Rust kinda struggles to detect changes
      in macro dependencies. Maybe just a build-script.
